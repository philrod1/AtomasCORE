General Rules:

Game Over when 19 atoms on the board.

Game starts with 6 atoms,usually Hydrogen, Helium and Lithium.

Minus Atom and Neutrino canâ€™t be placed on the board as Plus and Dark Plus can.

By using a Dark Plus, you can combine two Red Plus atoms to create a Beryllium atom.
Score += 2


Probabilities:

First 3rd move is always a Minus atom (when you start a new game).

Plus atom - every 6th move at worst case scenario.

Minus atom - every 20th move, the placement of the transformed Minus Atom to Plus Atom on the board does not count.
On fresh game, you get a Minus on the 3rd move and then on the 23rd.

Neutrino - spawns with a chance 1/60 when the score is above 1500.

Dark Plus - spawns with a chance 1/90 when the score is above 750.

The baseValue of possible atoms at the centre increases every 45 moves.

If you have atoms below baseValue in the circle they can still spawn with a chance of:
(number of lower atoms on the board )/(number of all atoms on the board)* (1/3)

It's not given in percent but how many moves it takes in average to spawn that atom,
so the probabilities for a plus to spawn in a round is 1/6.

The BaseValue is the lowest atom that can spawn and it's increased every 45 rounds.
The RangeValue is the difference between lowest possible Atom and the highest possible one,
which is 3 at the beginning. All atoms in this range have equal chances of being spawned.
However, if there is an atom on the board with a value lower than the BaseValue it can also be spawned.

The probability for lower atoms is:
(number of lower atoms on the board )/(number of all atoms on the board)* (1/3)


Score Calculation:

Simple reaction: ( if r == 1 )
Score = floor(1.5 * (Z + 1))

Chain reaction:
M = 1 + 0.5 * r             where r is the rth reaction
Sr = floor(M * (Z + 1))
B = 2 * M * (Zo - Z + 1)    where Zo is the outer atom value && Z is the middle atom

score = Sr               if Zo < Z
score = Sr + B           if Zo >= Z

If a Dark Plus is used:
Score = (Atom1Value + Atom2Value) / 2

If there is a chain with >= 4 elements on a side:
Creates an element with bonus value.  (Not yet implemented! - Phil)
